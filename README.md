And he told us about the improtance of the time in our life , if we don't value or time then the time will not value us , simple things made huge changes

**next lecture was of Maths**
we all introduce ourselves and i still don't remember anyones of name in my class , as I told you already that I am bad with it , so in our first class of maths we learned or you can say we practice about the derivated and the some calculas.
**on 13 and 14th of july there was no classes or any lecture because its weekend and we have off on saturday and sunday** 
in short i would say that i enjoyed this weekened alot , made new friends and alot of stuff 
##### DAY 5 (15TH of july)
_first lecture in audiotorium of dr. randhir sir_
They gave us information about how to use the website to upload the projected , websites like this github and also they shared many links with us like telegram , linked in etc . They explained every single step to us in a very understandable way so that no one can face any problem while logging in on any site . we all did the same and here I am donig the work as I was suppose to do .
**DR.Pyara lal garg** A great speaker as well as a brilliant personality, after every sentence he spoke on stages his works have there own tones of speaking , just like a sort of peotry 
the thing I learned from them is to delete the negativity in our minds and we should start thinking only about the positivity because as they said'' if u attract positivity then the positive things will attract you ''. Many students got motivated from there speeach and the energy they put in the auditorium was remarkable.
**MR. SONY GOYAL** They explained us how our next 4 years are going to be in this college , they taught us some mantras you can say , as far as I remember the 4 key points to keep in the mind were 1) learn 2)inquire 3) explore . they also told us to know why you choose this field of interest .how and why ? 
**pancham jai singh gill** here we go to the last entry of our todays knowleadge session , every entry was leveling up . He was having a positive energy flowing through his body , when he entered the audiotorium we all were feeling the energy in us . He started slow but soon when he catch up the pace and the vastness of his knowleadge about his field was too good , we all were lucky to meet him in person as the thing that we all were suprised was he was a 4th year students . overall it was a great experience .
# DAY 6 ( 16th of july) 
day of lectures apart from them , today on 16th july I was having english lectures or you can say activities and quizes. So we all were seprated in teams and we all were in groups of 4 , many participated and many of us don't . I was in team B . We gave some correct answer and got wrong sometimes , I  knew some answers and some of them I never heard of them before as it was of general knowledge based. in the end our team got 3rd place .
After that in the next lecture the next quiz was on its edge . teams were distributed and we all gave our best and we got 1st place , as to be honest I did nothing cuz in our team we got a guy having a vast knowledge about the vocabulary . I knew some answers but I was just mumbling in my brian .As the end result we got firt place .GOOD EXPERIENCE
